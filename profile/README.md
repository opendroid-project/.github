# All roads have to come to an end

## So long, farewell.

The **OpenDroid** project has officially been sunsetted. Maintaining the project became increasingly challenging due to the lengthy upkeep process and its relatively narrow scope. While OpenDroid aimed to provide documentation for AOSP(related) projects, the effort required to maintain the site and add new features to it took a huge amount of manpower. Even a simple feature such as search took a lot of effort to implement. We simply do not have the resources to maintain such a project. The website itself, while cool, lacked essential features such as a search function and proper categorization, making it difficult to scale effectively. OpenDroid also had an extremely small scope, relating to only AOSP. We have expanded our visions beyond that and hence have decided to sunset it.

## The spirit lives on.

Although OpenDroid has come to an end, its mission continues under a broader and more inclusive initiative: **FOSSonTop** ([fosson.top](https://fosson.top)). FOSSonTop is dedicated to providing documentation and resources for a wide range of open-source projects, extending beyond AOSP to cover various FOSS ecosystems.

If you were a contributor or user of OpenDroid, we encourage you to explore and contribute to FOSSonTop, where the goal remains the sameâ€”making FOSS documentation more accessible and well-maintained. Most of your current contributions, including AOSP-related guides, troubleshooting resources, and development insights, have been migrated to FOSSonTop, except for some lengthy guides that have not been transferred yet. You can find them under the relevant sections on [fosson.top](https://fosson.top).

Thank you to everyone who contributed to OpenDroid. Your efforts have laid the groundwork for a more expansive and sustainable documentation initiative!
